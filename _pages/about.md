WelcomeÔºÅ I am currently a master's student in the Department of Computer Technology and Applications at [Qinghai University](https://www.qhu.edu.cn/), focusing on the application of power electronics and advanced control theory to the power/new energy system.

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/), majoring in Electrical Engineering and Automation and minoring in Engineering Management. My academic work has been or will be published in internationally recognized conferences or journals. These [research](research) mainly include modeling, simulation, and control of power electronic systems based on inverter resources, application of artificial intelligence techniques in new energy sources, and exploration of advanced control theory. 

I worked as a system engineer for 4 years in [Chengdu Jiaoda Guangmang Technology Co., Ltd](http://en.ctny.com.cn/business), a national research unit for rail transportation automation and electrification engineering. During that time, I was responsible for electrical automation products' design, hardware, and software development.
